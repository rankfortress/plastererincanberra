	If you are looking to radically transform or upgrade your property, you’ll need a solution that will also enable you to move or create new robust and well-finished walls. Well placed walls can really open up spaces and add unexpected utility, style and modernity to your interior design giving an architectural finish to your project. Plasterboard or gyprock is essential for safe and reliable construction of new interior walls. These expansive sheets of gypsum compressed firmly between ‘facer’ and ‘backer’ layers are convenient to handle and install and offer a superb structural and safety profile.
